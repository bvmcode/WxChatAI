# Weather Chat AI - Detailed Technical Guide

## üèóÔ∏è **Detailed Architecture**

### **System Architecture Overview**

The Weather Chat AI system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Client Layer**: The system supports multiple client types including web applications, mobile apps, command-line tools, API clients, chat interfaces, and IoT devices. All clients communicate through standardized REST API endpoints.

**API Gateway Layer**: AWS API Gateway serves as the entry point, providing rate limiting, throttling, CORS handling, and authentication services. It routes requests to three main endpoints: /weather (POST), /health (GET), and /capabilities (GET).

**Lambda Layer**: Two Lambda functions handle the core business logic. The Weather Lambda Function contains request handling, weather service integration, and AI model service components. It processes weather queries, validates input, extracts location and intent, fetches weather data, and generates responses. The Health Lambda Function provides system monitoring, status checks, and metrics collection.

**Data Layer**: Three primary data stores support the system. DynamoDB stores conversation history and user sessions with automatic TTL cleanup. S3 provides weather data caching and static asset storage. CloudWatch collects logs and metrics for monitoring and debugging.

**External Services Layer**: The system integrates with AWS Bedrock for AI model access (Claude models), the National Weather Service API for real-time weather data, and geocoding services (Nominatim) for location resolution.

### **Data Flow Overview**

**Request Flow**: Client requests flow through API Gateway to Lambda functions, which process weather queries through the Weather Service and AI Model Service components.

**Response Flow**: AI Model Service generates contextual responses, which flow back through Lambda functions to API Gateway and finally to the client.

**Storage Flow**: Weather data from NWS API is processed by the Weather Service, stored in DynamoDB for conversation history, and cached in S3 for performance optimization.

### **Component Interaction Sequence**

The system follows a sequential processing pattern: Client sends request ‚Üí API Gateway receives and validates ‚Üí Lambda function processes ‚Üí Weather Service extracts location and fetches data ‚Üí AI Model Service enhances response ‚Üí Response is stored and returned to client.

## üîß **Detailed Component Breakdown**

### **1. API Gateway Configuration**

**REST API Structure**: The API Gateway exposes three main endpoints. The /weather endpoint accepts POST requests with weather queries and returns enhanced responses. The /health endpoint provides GET access for system health checks. The /capabilities endpoint returns GET responses describing available features and AI model status.

**CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled with wildcard origin support, allowing web applications to access the API from any domain. The configuration includes standard headers for content type, methods for POST and GET operations, and a maximum age of 86400 seconds.

**Rate Limiting**: API Gateway implements request throttling at 10,000 requests per second with burst capacity for handling traffic spikes.

### **2. Lambda Function Architecture**

**Weather Lambda Function Configuration**: The function runs on Python 3.11 runtime with 512 MB of memory allocation and a 30-second timeout. The handler is set to aws_lambda_handler.lambda_handler for processing incoming requests.

**Function Processing Flow**: The Lambda function follows a four-stage process. First, it receives and parses API Gateway events, extracting query parameters, user IDs, and session IDs. Second, it initializes the Weather Service and parses weather queries using either AI model or rule-based parsing. Third, it geocodes locations and fetches weather data from external APIs. Finally, it generates responses using AI enhancement with fallback to rule-based generation.

**Environment Variables**: The function uses three key environment variables. CONVERSATIONS_TABLE specifies the DynamoDB table name for storing conversation history. WEATHER_BUCKET defines the S3 bucket for weather data caching. LOG_LEVEL controls the verbosity of logging output.

### **3. DynamoDB Schema**

**Table Structure**: The conversations table uses a composite key with user_id as the hash key and timestamp as the range key. This design allows efficient querying of user conversation history while supporting time-based sorting and filtering.

**Data Model**: Each conversation record contains user identification, timestamp information, the original query text, generated response, AI enhancement flag, extracted location and weather type, target day information, and TTL for automatic cleanup.

**Billing Configuration**: The table uses pay-per-request billing mode, which automatically scales based on actual usage without requiring capacity planning. TTL is enabled with a 24-hour expiration for conversation records.

### **4. S3 Bucket Structure**

**Cache Organization**: The S3 bucket organizes data into logical directories. The forecasts directory stores weather forecast data indexed by latitude and longitude coordinates. The geocoding directory caches location-to-coordinate mappings. The current directory holds real-time weather conditions.

**Log Management**: The logs directory contains Lambda function logs and API Gateway access logs for monitoring and debugging purposes.

**Temporary Storage**: The temp directory provides workspace for Lambda deployment packages and temporary processing files.

### **5. AI Model Service Architecture**

**Bedrock Integration**: The AI Model Service initializes a Bedrock runtime client and supports multiple model configurations. It handles both query parsing and response generation through AI model invocations.

**Model Selection**: The service supports five different Bedrock models with varying capabilities. Claude Haiku provides fast, cost-effective processing for testing scenarios. Claude Sonnet offers excellent balance of speed and quality for production use. Claude Opus delivers the highest quality for complex queries. Llama 2 provides an alternative option with good performance. Titan offers AWS-native integration with competitive pricing.

**Fallback Mechanisms**: When AI model access fails, the service automatically falls back to rule-based parsing and response generation, ensuring system reliability and continuous operation.

## üîÑ **Detailed Request Processing**

### **Step 1: Request Reception**

**API Gateway Event Structure**: The Lambda function receives events containing HTTP method, path information, headers including content type and user agent, request body with JSON payload, and request context with unique request ID and stage information.

**Input Validation**: The function validates required fields including query text, optional user identification, and session tracking parameters.

### **Step 2: Query Parsing**

**AI Model Parsing**: The system sends queries to Claude models with structured prompts requesting extraction of location, time reference, weather intent, and question classification.

**Rule-based Fallback**: When AI parsing fails, the system uses pattern matching to extract location information, day references, and weather type classifications from natural language queries.

### **Step 3: Weather Data Retrieval**

**Geocoding Process**: Location names are converted to latitude and longitude coordinates using geocoding services, enabling precise weather data retrieval.

**NWS API Integration**: The system makes sequential API calls to the National Weather Service. First, it retrieves forecast URLs from the points endpoint. Then, it fetches detailed weather data from the forecast endpoint.

**Data Structure**: Weather responses contain properties with periods array, each including name, temperature, temperature unit, short forecast, and detailed forecast information.

### **Step 4: Response Generation**

**AI Response Enhancement**: The system prepares weather summaries and sends them to AI models for contextual response generation with natural language processing.

**Rule-based Fallback**: When AI generation fails, the system creates template-based responses using extracted weather information and query context.

**Final Response Format**: Responses include the generated text, original query, user and session identifiers, timestamp information, and AI enhancement flag.

## üîí **Security Architecture**

### **IAM Permission Matrix**

**Lambda Permissions**: The Lambda execution role has minimal required permissions including DynamoDB read/write access for conversation storage, S3 read/write access for weather data caching, and Bedrock invoke permissions for AI model access.

**Service Isolation**: Each AWS service operates with least privilege access, preventing unauthorized access to resources outside their designated scope.

**Permission Granularity**: Permissions are scoped to specific resources and actions, following security best practices for production environments.

### **Network Security**

**API Gateway Security**: All external communication flows through API Gateway with HTTPS enforcement and request validation.

**Lambda Security**: Lambda functions can optionally run within VPC private subnets with NAT gateway access for enhanced network isolation.

**Data Encryption**: All data in transit uses TLS encryption, while data at rest in S3 and DynamoDB uses AWS-managed encryption keys.
